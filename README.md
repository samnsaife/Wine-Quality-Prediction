# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a basic machine learning application that predicts the quality of red wine using its physicochemical properties.  
A **Random Forest Classifier** is used to train the model and make predictions based on the given dataset.

The project is implemented and executed in **Google Colab** and later structured for hosting on **GitHub**.
